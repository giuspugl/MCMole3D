# MCMole3D
Monte-Carlo MOlecular Line Emission MCMOLE3D is a python package which simulates the 3D  molecular cloud emission in the Milky Way. In particular, it can simulate both  the unpolarized and polarized emission coming from the   first rotational line of Carbon Monoxide (CO, `J=1-0`).

For the package  documentation please visit [MCMOle3D doc]( http://giuspugl.github.io/ ).

For a full description of the first scientific results obtained with `MCMole3D`  see  [Puglisi et al 2017](http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07856)

**To run  the package**,  you have to add the  path of MCMOLE directory  to your  `PYTHONPATH`:

`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/your/MCMole3D`

then, to import it on a `python` script:

`from cloudmodel import *`
